# The Yam Harvest Game made by Marianne Agulhon (Ironhack PAR WEBDEV 2023 - Project 1)

## Why do I choose this game?

I've worked for 7 years at the Tourism Office of New Caledonia and I wanted to share my experience on this French archipelago in the Pacific Ocean by creating a game inspired by this island for my very first project at Ironhack. 

## About this game?

It is a HTML/CSS/JS game called the "Yam Harvest Game". 
The goal of the game is to help a Kanak farmer to collect as many yams as possible in less than 1 minute while avoiding the poisonous mushrooms on his way that could kill him and bring the game to a hasty end. 
It is a funny way to introduce you to New Caledonia!
FYI, New Caledonia's inhabitants are called Caledonians and among them live the Kanak, one of the first peoples, whose culture is based on ancestral traditions such as the harvesting of the yam (tuber) which gave rhythm to the life of the tribes. It mainly symbolizes man and each stage of his culture still gives rise to customary ceremonies (births, weddings, funeralsâ€¦).
Hope you'll enjoy it!

## Implementation

- A grid to display the game. 
- DOM manipulation.
- Use of switch() to move the player "farmer".
- Use of Math.floor() and Math.random() to get new random positions for the yams and mushrooms.
- Use of setInterval() and parseInt() to add a timer.
- Mainly flexbox CSS to structure the game design.

## What's next?

- Add other levels to progress in the game with more complexity (i.e: moving mushrooms).
- Add lives to the farmer player with an increment/ decrement score depending on if he gets yams or hits mushrooms in order to extend the play time and make him loose regarding the time and how many mushrooms he hits.
- Add different enemies and work with JS class and constructor.
- Add move options to the farmer player.
- Clean my code and structure it with different JS files.
- Add responsiveness to play it on smartphone. 
- Improve the design with New Caledonia items to a better immersion (rainforest playground, farmer identity, New Caledonian style, audio and colors).
