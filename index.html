          Welcome to New Caledonia, a beautiful French archipelago in the South
          Pacific Ocean! Its inhabitants are called Caledonians and among them
          live the Kanak, one of the first peoples, whose culture is based on
          ancestral traditions such as the harvesting of the yam (tuber) which
          gave rhythm to the life of the tribes. It mainly symbolizes man and
          each stage of his culture still gives rise to customary ceremonies
          (births, weddings, funerals…).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dive into a Kanak tribe and help a farmer (◀️ ▶️ 🔼 🔽) to harvest as
          many yams as possible for his tribe in less than 1 minute.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Beware of poisonous mushrooms during your harvest or you will kill our
          farmer and ruin the crop!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong> Hint:</strong> if too many mushrooms block your path, press
          keyQ (A) to cut them!
