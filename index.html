            Welcome to New Caledonia, a beautiful French archipelago in the South
            Pacific Ocean! Its inhabitants are called Caledonians and among them
            live the Kanak, whose culture is based on ancestral traditions such as
            the harvesting of the yam (tuber)!
          </p>
          <p>
            Dive into a Kanak tribe and help a farmer to harvest as
            many yams as possible for his tribe in less than 1 minute with: ‚óÄÔ∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è üîº üîΩ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beware of poisonous mushrooms during your harvest or you will kill our
            farmer and ruin the crop!
          </p>
          <p>
            Hint: if too many mushrooms block your path, press keyQ (A) to cut
            them!
